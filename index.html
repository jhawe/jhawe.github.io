<h3> Hey, listen! </h3>
(weird <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)">Navi</a> reference)

<p>Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Johann, bioinformatician, media consumer, sports and music enthusiast
  (although, these sites shall be focused on the bioinformatics aspects of my interests). </p>

<p>I studied Bioinformatics (BSc and Msc) at the joined program of the <a href="https://www.lmu.de">LMU</a> and <a href="https://www.tum.de">TUM</a> in Munich.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm a senior PhD student at <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/research/groups/heinig-lab/index.html">Matthias Heinig's Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/" target="_blank">Institute of Computational Biology</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html">Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen</a>.
My current work is focused on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00535/full">network inference from multi-omics data</a> and understanding the general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" target="_blank">genetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetic</a> principles of gene expression regulation.
</p><p>
  Moreover, I'm very excited about all the possibilities AI and IT in general can offer patients, such as improving patient diagnostics and treatment.
While this is a challenging field, not alone due to data security and data heterogeneity issues, I'm very much looking forward to tackling projects in this direction!
</p>

<p>Ok, some quicklinks at this point for the impatient? Let's see... <a href="/publications">here</a> you can find a current list of <b>publications</b> (more to come!),
  <a href="/cv">here</a> you can find my <b>CV</b> and
  you can also find me on <b><a href="https://twitter.com/johannhawe" target="_blank">twitter</a></b>, and.. well, yeah, that's all for now. Let's go on.
</p>

<p>
If you dig more through these pages you may also find a collection of posts mostly on data analysis.<br />
I'll be analyzing different and mostly random <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and other datasets
with the goal of

<ul>
<li>improving my own data analysis prowess</li>
<li>getting familar with hitherto unfamiliar topics, packages, etc.</li>
<li>describing, explaining and teaching some aspects of data analysis I feel confident with</li>
</ul>

on a more or less regular basis (probably not <i>that</i> regular, really depends on whether or not my schedule permits me to do this..).
For the first few posts I'll probably choose some datasets I'm already
acquainted with (at least w.r.t. there general topic).
I'll proceed to exploring other, random datasets, where I choose to filter for
sports, music or biology related ones (mostly).
Occasionally, and if inspiration hits me, I might create some more method
related posts.
There, I'll endeavor to make 'statistical hocus-pocus' more accessible to the interested reader.
Moreover, I might throw in some random other posts about topics/issues I came across and I feel could be important for the general public.
</p>

<p>Other than the stuff described above, these pages should simply, and maybe most importantly, serve to introduce myself.
  </p>

<p>
Let's see where this goes and welcome to the journey!
</p>
<p>
Until then, farewell!
</p>
