<h3> Hey, listen! </h3>
(weird <a target="_blank" href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Navi">Navi</a> reference)

<p>Glad you found your way here! Apparently some people do still find the index
page, huh?</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Johann, bioinformatician, media consumer, sports and metal enthusiast 
  (although, this blog shall be focused on the bioinformatics aspects of my interests).
Below you may find a collection of posts on... data analysis (what. a. surprise) <br />
In this blog I'll be analyzing different and mostly random <a href="www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> datasets
with the goal of

<ul>
<li>improving my own data analysis prowess</li>
<li>getting familar with hitherto unfamiliar topics</li>
<li>describing, explaining and teaching some aspects of data analysis I feel confident with</li>
</ul>

For the first few posts I'll probably choose some datasets I'm already
acquainted with (at least w.r.t. its general topic).
I'll proceed to exploring other, random datasets, where I choose to filter for
sports, music or biology related ones (mostly).
Occasionally, and if inspiration hits me, I might create some more method
related posts in which I endeavor to make 'statistical hocus-pocus' more accessible to the interested reader.
</p>
<p>
Let's see where this goes and welcome to the journey!
</p>
<p>
Until then, farewell!
