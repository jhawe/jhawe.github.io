<h3> Hey, listen! </h3>
(weird <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)">Navi</a> reference)

<p>Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Johann.</p>

<p>I was trained as a software developer at <a href="https://www.modulacht.de/" target="_blank">ModulAcht e. K.</a> and have several years of experience in developing websites (C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS and such), desktop and lately also mobile applications (mostly C# and Java, for mobile development Flutter/Dart).</p>

<p>I further studied Bioinformatics (BSc and Msc) at the joined program of the <a href="https://www.lmu.de" target="_blank">LMU</a> and <a href="https://www.tum.de" target="_blank">TUM</a> in Munich.</p>
<p>I did my PhD at <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/research/groups/heinig-lab/index.html">Matthias Heinig's Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/" target="_blank">Institute of Computational Biology</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html">Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen</a>.
During my PhD I focused on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00535/full">network inference from multi-omics data</a> and understanding the general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" target="_blank">genetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetic</a> principles of gene expression regulation.
</p>

<p> Right now, I'm very excited about all the possibilities AI and IT in general can offer in medical settings, such as improving patient diagnostics and treatment.
While this is a challenging field, not alone due to data security/privacy and data heterogeneity issues, I'm very much looking forward to tackling projects in this direction.
  To this end, I am currently doign a PostDoc at the <a href="https://www.dhm.mhn.de/de/home.cfm">German Heart Center</a>, where I'm both analyzing clinical and molecular patient data
  and building a large infrastructure to ease their integration and analysis.
</p>

<p>Hm, what else? <a href="/publications">Here</a> you can find a current list of <b>publications</b> (more to come!),
  <a href="/cv">Here</a> you can find my <b>CV</b> and
  you can also find me on <b><a href="https://twitter.com/johannhawe" target="_blank">twitter</a></b>.
  Here's a link to my <a itemprop="sameAs" content="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3890-303X" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3890-303X" target="orcid.widget" rel="me noopener noreferrer" style="vertical-align:top;"><img src="https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png" style="width:1em;margin-right:.5em;" alt="ORCID iD icon">ORCID</a>, and.. well, yeah, that's all for now. Let's go on.
</p>

<p>
If you dig more through these pages you may also find a collection of posts mostly on data analysis.<br />
I'll be analyzing different and mostly random <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and other datasets whenever I got some spare time. I'll also post about other stuff which I
  found to be either difficult for me to solve or simply interesting or which I feel could be important for others, too.
</p>

<p>
Until then, farewell!
