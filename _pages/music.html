excerpt: This is a brief take on metal and music in general

Ah, music, what would we be without it?
<hr />
<p>
I realize this site is and should be about data analysis, but why not get some
inspiration/motivation going by listening to some music?
</p><p>
Of course, not everyone is drawn towards the same kind of music but must of us
can relate: this one song, maybe linked with some (positive) memory... simply fantastic!
Or just more ambient songs, to help us get some concentrated and inspirational
work going. There are oh so many reasons for us to enjoy music!
</p><p>
And while some general music tastes might differ more drastically from the so
called 'norm', often we can find particular works which just speak to use,
although they might not clearly fit our oh so developed taste... or maybe, these
specific songs lead us to develop our taste?
</p><p>
Anyway, long story short: here is one of my spotify playlists.
This is a mix of rock/metal songs I found to be rather fond of, be it for their
technial finesse, their groove or the emotions carried with them. <br />
Ah, and lest I forget, since I mentioned concentrated work: I'll put in another
two playlists for free (not by me) with some more 'relaxed' tones.
</p>

Enjoy!
