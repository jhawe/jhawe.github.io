This page and its contents are created by me: the guy on the left!

It's about data science and having fun with public and interesting datasets
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) using [R](www.r-project.de).
Spoiler alert: I'll sporadically talk about or include references to other stuff
I'm interested in, such as specific music, sports and other more 'non-sciency'
stuff.

If you are not familiar with R or specifically with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
I recommend you give it a shot and work through one of the numerous tutorials out there
on the world-wide-web (e.g. on [DataCamp](www.datacamp.com): [R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) or
[tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)).
You already familiar with the R universe? Great!
Still, maybe you'd like some quick reference for specific R based tasks (say,
how to work with [stringr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf) or [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)), check
out the R-studio [cheatsheets](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets).

This homepage is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
and built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's
